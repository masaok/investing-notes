## Willow

Google's breakthrough with the "Willow" quantum chip was announced on **November 30, 2024**.

Quantum computing has recently achieved significant milestones, particularly with Google's introduction of its new quantum chip, "Willow." This chip has demonstrated two major advancements:

1. **Enhanced Error Correction**: Willow addresses a longstanding challenge in quantum computing by showing that increasing the number of qubits leads to a reduction in errors, thereby enhancing the system's quantum coherence.

2. **Unprecedented Computational Speed**: The chip completed a computation in under five minutes—a task that would take a conventional supercomputer 10 septillion years, a timeframe vastly exceeding the age of the universe.

Developed in Santa Barbara, California, Willow comprises 105 qubits and represents a crucial step toward building large-scale, practical quantum computers. This breakthrough has garnered significant attention, with Alphabet's stock rising over 5% following the announcement.
