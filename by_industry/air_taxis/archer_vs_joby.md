## Air Taxi Companies

Air taxi companies are at the forefront of developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, aiming to revolutionize urban transportation. Several key players are leading this emerging industry:

**Joby Aviation**: Based in California, Joby is developing a five-seat eVTOL aircraft with a top speed of 200 mph and a range of 100 miles. The company plans to commence commercial operations by the end of 2025, with initial services expected in Dubai.

**Archer Aviation**: Also headquartered in California, Archer is working on its "Midnight" eVTOL aircraft, designed for short urban trips. The company has received FAA certification for commercial operations and aims to launch services in 2025, with plans to operate routes between major airports and city centers.

**Vertical Aerospace**: A UK-based company, Vertical Aerospace is developing the VX4, a zero-emission eVTOL aircraft with a top speed of 200 mph and a range exceeding 100 miles. The company has secured significant investments and pre-orders, including from American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic.

**Wisk Aero**: A joint venture between Boeing and Kitty Hawk, Wisk is focusing on autonomous eVTOL aircraft. The company has conducted over 1,750 test flights and is collaborating with Airservices Australia on airspace integration, aiming to launch self-flying air taxis by 2030.

**Volocopter**: A German company, Volocopter is developing the VoloCity, an eVTOL designed for urban air mobility. The company has conducted crewed test flights and plans to launch commercial services in the near future.

These companies are actively working towards making air taxis a viable mode of urban transportation, with several planning to launch commercial services within the next few years.

## JOBY vs ACHR

Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation are prominent players in the emerging electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft industry, each with distinct strategies and progress toward commercializing air taxi services.

**Company Overviews:**

- **Joby Aviation**: Founded in 2005, Joby is developing a five-seat eVTOL aircraft capable of speeds up to 200 mph and a range of 100 miles. The company plans to commence commercial operations by the end of 2025, with initial services expected in Dubai.

- **Archer Aviation**: Established in 2018, Archer is developing the "Midnight" eVTOL aircraft, designed to carry four passengers and a pilot for distances up to 100 miles at speeds reaching 150 mph. The aircraft is optimized for round trips of about 20 miles each way, allowing for minimal recharging times between journeys.

**Business Models:**

- **Joby Aviation**: Pursues a vertically integrated approach, developing most components in-house and planning to own and operate its fleet, offering transportation as a service through a dedicated ride-hailing network. This strategy allows for optimized performance and control over the customer experience but requires substantial upfront investment.

- **Archer Aviation**: Adopts a more traditional model, relying on established Tier 1 aerospace suppliers for components and focusing on manufacturing aircraft. Archer has secured partnerships with companies like Stellantis for manufacturing and United Airlines for potential aircraft sales, aiming to integrate its eVTOLs into existing transportation networks.

**Financial Positions:**

- **Joby Aviation**: As of the second quarter of 2024, Joby reported $825 million in cash and short-term investments, providing significant operating flexibility as the company pushes toward commercialization.

- **Archer Aviation**: Archer's financials for the second quarter of 2024 illustrate its focus on managed growth, with strategic partnerships providing financial backing and access to manufacturing expertise to scale production.

**Market Entry and Partnerships:**

- **Joby Aviation**: Plans to launch commercial services in Dubai by early 2026 and has partnered with Delta Air Lines to launch eVTOL flights in New York and Los Angeles.

- **Archer Aviation**: Aims to begin commercial flights as soon as 2025, with initial U.S. markets including New York City, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Miami. The company has received a $1 billion order from United Airlines and plans to operate routes between major airports and city centers.

**Regulatory Progress:**

Both companies are working toward FAA certification, with expectations to achieve this milestone by 2026, enabling the commencement of commercial operations.

**Conclusion:**

Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation are at the forefront of the eVTOL industry, each with unique strategies and partnerships. Joby's vertically integrated model focuses on controlling the entire customer experience, while Archer leverages established partnerships to facilitate manufacturing and market entry. Both companies aim to revolutionize urban air mobility, with commercial operations anticipated to begin between 2025 and 2026.

## Airline Partnerships

Both Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation have established significant partnerships with major airlines to advance their electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft services.

**Joby Aviation:**

- **Delta Air Lines**: In October 2022, Delta Air Lines entered into a multi-year, multi-market commercial and operational partnership with Joby Aviation. This collaboration aims to deliver sustainable home-to-airport transportation services, with Delta making an upfront equity investment of $60 million in Joby, with the potential to increase up to $200 million as milestones are achieved. The initial launch is anticipated to target New York and Los Angeles.

**Archer Aviation:**

- **United Airlines**: In August 2022, United Airlines paid Archer a $10 million deposit for 100 electric flying taxis. In November 2022, Archer and United Airlines announced plans for the first electric air taxi route in the U.S., with an initial route between Newark Liberty International Airport and the Downtown Manhattan Heliport.

- **Southwest Airlines**: In July 2024, Southwest Airlines and Archer Aviation signed a memorandum of understanding to develop operational plans for electric air taxi networks in California. This collaboration focuses on airports where Southwest operates, aiming to integrate eVTOL aircraft into their services.

These partnerships underscore the commitment of both Joby and Archer to integrate eVTOL technology into existing airline operations, enhancing urban air mobility and providing sustainable transportation solutions.
