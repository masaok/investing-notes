The stock market crash of August 2024 was the result of several interrelated factors that collectively undermined investor confidence and led to a significant downturn across global financial markets.

**1. Unexpected Monetary Policy Changes**

- **Bank of Japan's Interest Rate Hike**: On July 31, 2024, the Bank of Japan unexpectedly raised its interest rates by 15 basis points to 0.25%, marking a departure from its long-standing near-zero rate policy. This move strengthened the yen and disrupted the "carry trade," where investors borrow in low-interest currencies to invest in higher-yielding assets. The unwinding of these trades led to significant sell-offs in global markets.

**2. Weak U.S. Economic Indicators**

- **Disappointing Jobs Report**: The U.S. Labor Department reported that non-farm payrolls increased by only 114,000 in July 2024, significantly below expectations and down from June's revised figures. Additionally, the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, the highest since October 2021. These indicators heightened fears of a potential recession in the U.S.

**3. Overvaluation in the Technology Sector**

- **Correction in AI-Driven Stocks**: Major technology companies, particularly those involved in artificial intelligence, had experienced substantial growth leading up to August 2024. However, concerns over overvaluation led to a sharp correction. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, including Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia, collectively lost approximately $1 trillion in market capitalization during the downturn.

**4. Geopolitical Tensions**

- **Middle East Conflicts**: Escalating conflicts in the Middle East added to global uncertainty, affecting investor sentiment and contributing to market volatility.

**5. Political Uncertainty in the U.S.**

- **Election-Related Market Anxiety**: The political landscape in the U.S., particularly the upcoming presidential election, created additional uncertainty. Investors were concerned about potential shifts in economic policies, which contributed to market instability.

These factors combined to create a perfect storm, leading to a significant downturn in global stock markets in August 2024.
